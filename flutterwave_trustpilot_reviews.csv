For over a year, i have been requeting for refund of this money (as refund was done and applied for in parts). The money has been refunded to Flutterwave for over a year. I have only got one batch paid to me - without getting the other three. I've done emails and emails. Ive also called. It's always the lame excuse of ""thier partners"" are holding the money"", or ""we are working on this"". The annonying part is that the refund is done in Naira, while payment was made in USD. People who paid via other platforms/banks have got theirs within weeks. I feel I've been robbed by this scam, peddled by Flutterwave. I have kept quiet for too long and will begin to speak up.

Convert ur Naira to Dollars, Euros, Pounds etc.Additionally:1. Ur customers can pay u with a plethora of payment methods at lightening speeds2. Customer service is officially stated to respond in 15 mins., but these people do it in just under 4.3. They even let you collect subscription payments from ur customers, not just on a monthly or weekly basis, but even DAILY and HOURLY!I'm utterly STOKED!The only thing close to a drawback for me is that, they always compel me to enter an OTP each time I try to log back in after restarting my browser — which may be their way of being security conscious, although very stressful for me at the same time.All in all, they're good. I highly recommend!",5,"Jul 15, 2025"

9,Robert Mukabe,1,"I was so glad that flutterwave launched in Zambia. I thought finally we had a payment gateway that we can use in Zambia as all online payment gateways don't work in Zambia. I quickly went online to open an account so that I can link it to my website. Firstly, there was no option for me to directly open an account because, on the drop-down list of countries, Zambia was not there! I was directed to contact the support team. That's when the nightmare started. I got an automated message which even a 7 year old can tell that it's an automated message. I was told they will get in touch with-in 24 to 48 hours, 1week later nothing happened. I wrote them a reminder. The reply started asking me for information that I had already provided on my initial contact form but I still went ahead and gave them the information. 2 days later I again wrote them yet another reminder, shockingly I got a message that "" they are closing my ticket and I should always get in touch if I needed to"" without opening my account. 26 emails later, back and forth my account has not been opened yet. I have just gone back to my ancient way of getting payments from my online customers. With flutterwave I am very and I stress very disappointed. If they can be so useless when on-boarding clients, imagine you have an issue which needs fixing? I am sure you will go in endless circles. They don't seem to understand how to run their own business. It looks like a bunch of guys just got together to try and provide a service they don't even understand properly. It's a shame.Zambians STAY AWAY from FLUTTERWAVE!!! Uwa kwensha ubushiku bamutasha nga bwacha!Don't say I never warned you!!",1,"May 31, 2025"

10,Godwin Ikpong,1,"To some, it’s a good company and to others a bad company, but for me, it’s the worse company I have ever dealt with. I am already preparing to report them to the right authority. They held a transaction I did 5 years ago as fraudulent. Had part of the money refunded to the customer, some of the money in my dashboard but I can’t withdraw, after 3 years they let me withdraw part of the money and still hold the balance. Even after following all due process they instructed, submitting all documents, all I get is, they will get back to me and never do. I have sent an email and open tickets over 3 times and they end up just ghosting me. I have all the evidence in me emails and I can share them across if uploading of photos is allowed. They just hold people’s money for no reason. I feel like, they are the real fraudulent company. Try to tell me they changed their terms to a withdrawal threshold of $1,000 and keep on giving excuses and at the end ghost me. DO NOT USE THEM, especially if you are a freelancer getting paid from people in different countries, they will hold your money forever and keep telling you stories.",1,"May 6, 2025"

10,Jak Rennison,18,"They sent all of our money to the wrong bank!We signed up with flutterwave as it seemed like a good option to take payments in Africa. The onboarding process took about 3 week where instead of filling out our details we just had to send certificates and proof of business etc and our bank statements plus proof of bank incorporation. In the first month we took in around $600 through flutterwave. Which they lost due to making a mistake in onboarding. Rather than doing the right thing and sending us our money back and dealing with their mistake internally they have just been sending us generic template emails promising to reply in 24-72 hours and the reply is usually ‘we’re still working on it give us another 24-72 hours’ FOR OVER A MONTH! Terrible customer service, terrible onboarding process. And some hidden fees just for good measure. We were told the fees would be around 3.5% but was closer to 10% of our payment. We are now needing to pay for legal action as they cannot deal with the situation",1,"Feb 27, 2025"

After reaching out to the company I was making the payment to and receiving no assistance, I decided to contact Flutterwave directly. To my delight, they resolved the issues in the shortest time possible.However, I would like to suggest streamlining the issue resolution process by ensuring that concerns are received by one attendant and immediately forwarded to the appropriate department. This would minimize the need for multiple personnel handling the issue before it reaches the right person.Thank you!",5,"Feb 11, 2025"

11,Choice,3,"Flutterwave is a BIG SCAM - IHS REFUND!I had applied for IHS Refund as I had used Barter by Flutterwave to make this payment in 2022. The UKVI team had refunded this money back to Flutterwave since August 2024. However, I am yet to get any payments.When I contacted Flutterwave in September 2024, I was asked to go fetch ARN and proof of payment from the UKVI. After weeks, I got this information and gave it back to Flutterwave. Flutterwave now took my GT Bank account number (I am not even arguing why they want to pay a dollar reimbursement in naira), and since then, its been nothing.I did another protest email to Flutterwave last week of November 2024 and they promised to pay me or get back since last week. I am still not yet paid.A lady from their team later called me and gave me the rubbish excuse that ""our partners are with your money"". When I asked for the name of these so-called partners, she would not tell me. I also asked for their complaint policy; she will also not tell me or send me this. I also asked her what regulatory bodies in Nigeria I could escalate this matter to, and she told me ""she was not in a position to tell me this.""I am really frustrated. The UKVI team asked them to send a letter in their letterhead saying they are yet to receive this funds. They still will not do this.The painful part is that this is the 1st of 4 reimbursements that will be paid to them. Each of this reimbursement is over $300. What do humans gain by defrauding others? It is also unfortunate that the UKVI cannot allow persons to submit new accounts for payments.",1,"Dec 15, 2024"

14,Olaoluwa,3,"""FLUTTERWAVE IS A SCAM! AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!I can’t believe how utterly disgusting my experience with Flutterwave has been. If you’re even remotely considering using them, RUN in the opposite direction! They are hands down the most deceptive, incompetent, and fraudulent company I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I wish I had looked up their reviews before trusting them—it’s the biggest regret of my life!Here’s how they’ve completely destroyed my business: A client made a payment through Flutterwave, and instead of releasing MY money to me, these thieves locked it up and slapped me with some nonsense excuse that I need to have a live website to access it. Are you joking?! They never mentioned this requirement during registration, not in their terms, not in their policies—NOWHERE. They’ve essentially trapped my money behind a wall of lies, and I can’t do anything about it.I raised a complaint before my website went down, thinking they’d fix it quickly. BIG MISTAKE! They’ve done absolutely nothing to help. No solutions, no urgency, just empty words and useless support. Now my website is down because I don’t even have the funds to keep it online. I’m up at 4:39 a.m., desperate to get this resolved, and Flutterwave is telling me they’ll “look into it in 1-3 days.” WHAT?! My business is burning, my reputation is on the line, and they’re acting like it’s no big deal. This is how they treat their customers? It’s beyond pathetic—it’s criminal!I deeply regret ever signing up for this disaster of a service. If I had read the reviews beforehand, I would’ve saved myself this nightmare. Flutterwave is a complete scam, and their customer service is non-existent. They’ll take your money, make you jump through ridiculous hoops, and then leave you high and dry when you need them the most. They don’t care about you, your business, or your livelihood.To make matters worse, they’re now trying to paint this mess like it’s somehow MY fault. How dare they?! They’re the ones who failed to disclose important requirements, they’re the ones who have hijacked my funds, and yet they have the audacity to act like I’m the problem. It’s an absolute disgrace.If you value your time, your money, or your sanity, do NOT—under any circumstances—use Flutterwave. They are nothing but con artists masquerading as a payment service. They’ve ruined my business, trashed my reputation, and left me completely broke. I can’t meet my client’s deadline, I can’t pay for my website, and I have no way to recover from this disaster because of Flutterwave’s blatant fraud.There are better, more reliable platforms out there—Paystack, Stripe, PayU—literally ANYTHING but Flutterwave! These scammers will destroy your business without a second thought. Save yourself the agony I’m going through and avoid this company at all costs. They are thieves, liars, and should not be trusted by anyone, EVER.""",1,"Sep 27, 2024"

Through that I wrote to the service but I was amazed because many people attended to me, though I couldn't be patient because of fear, they reassured me several times and ask all the information concerning the wrong transaction I did. But after 3 days the reverse of my funds came back in my account. I was very surprised because I thought it impossible to be served.Thank you so much flutterwave. I trust you 😇🤩❤️🙏💪",5,"Jul 24, 2024"

17,Rob Beauchamp,3,"Flutterwave was not a choice for my fiance and I.  I am using a money sending app from the United States and sending money to my fiance in Nigeria.Suddenly my fiance received a notice from her bank where her funds from me are received, and when she went to her bank they gave her a four page court order from the Federal Court of Nigeria where Flutterwave made claims against account holders in 25 different banks in Nigeria.In our situation, they went back 3 months to where I sent her the same amount twice on one day and once on the next.  They claimed that these transfers were erroneous and they said they were trying to collect this money back from her as if they had not been intentional. So they took the money in her account and put an restriction on her account until she deposits enough money to replace the full amount of those three transfers.I wrote to them in an email and explained that all three of those transfers were intentional and I requested that they replace the money they took and release the restriction on her account. I was the one who sent the transfers, so I alone know what my intentions were.  I even explained to them that I would often just use the same amount that I last sent, by choosing ""send again"" to make the transfer process a bit quicker.I have not been able to send my fiance money for food, nutrition or clean water for 4 weeks now because these scoundrels are ignoring what I have told them, and it is very sad and distressing that I cannot get them to take this situation seriously.In my book, they are scammers trying to take money from people for no good reason and making false claims to try to forcibly take money from decent people like myself and my fiance.  My fiance is suffering because of their irresponsible practices, and unfounded claims.  Even her bank is on the verge of suing them in court as they told her this morning.I have sent them many emails to no avail.",1,"Jul 24, 2024"

20,Ephraim,3,"Very frustrating experience with this company. I have used Flutterwave as the payment processor for my website for a few years. I have never had a transaction go smoothly, from receiving payment to settling into my bank account. There is always an issue along the line. Either the client cannot pay using their card, or the client pays successfully, but Flutterwave claims they didn't receive the funds. Or the client pays successfully, and Flutterwave gets the funds, but there are errors and issues with settling to my bank account. In my most recent experience, it took 90 back-and-forth emails between them and me and a whole month to settle one payment successfully. They take 24-72 hours to review your email and respond with another request. The website is also set up in a way that a user cannot even edit their bank details. You must contact support and complete crazy verifications that take a long time before they edit it for you. I have lost so many clients due to these payment frustrations, which is the end of the road for me and them. I have had enough. Flutterwave has the potential to rival big brands, but it will only get there if they improve. They are currently losing their existing customer base.",1,"Jun 11, 2024"

Also on their website, they say they blacklist scammers but it's not true.I just called about a refund I was supposed to get from a hosting company and the rubbish customer agent said I can't ask for a refund without even asking the details or the name of the hosting company. She just said: ""contact your bank for a refund"" when she clearly knows Nigerian banks are so useless that they don't care if you are scammed millions of naira. How would they blacklist the scammer that is a merchant using their platform to scam people when they couldn't be bothered to ask who performed the SCAM so they could investigate? Do not use Flutterwave or use but do not trust their words. Your money would be lost and they don't blacklist any scam merchant as they claim to do!!!",1,"Jun 5, 2024"

Despite sending them my affiliate link and ID on that platform, Flutterwave still refuses to approve my business account!What I also noticed while filling out their online form was having a website was optional.

Please be wary of using Flutter; a better bet would be to find another alternative e,g paystack or stripe, please.I was trying to update my account info, and I got locked, so I decided to reach out to customer service, like every educated person would.Guess what ?1 ticket led to 2 and 3 and i had to raise over 10 tickets within a 3 week period...no response, no resolution.Every time you send a mail, see what happens guys...you get redirected to a new customer service rep who seems to have no idea of the backlog of information you've previously submitted.They might argue against this statement, you might see a flutter wave reply to this comment and apologize for the poor service BUT hear me out guys, I honestly believe they don't really care.I tried all you could imagine, from CCing other Flutterwave accounts to going headhunting for the CS reps I saw tagged in my mail, on LinkedIn.I was sure to politely explain all that was going in all my ticket submissions, but still no closeout or substantial response.I should also point out that over 5 different Flutterwave CS reps handled my multiple tickets, but NOT one could follow through with closing it out.It was cycles of automated responses and then finally, no reply, it was almost like it was intentional.I would quote a ticket ID and attach all requested information, and they would see it, and the next reply would be...please supply so and so information...in my head, it's like don't you see the thread, ma?I just sent that information right now...can't you see it?..it's right there...pheew.It was almost hilarious.I know you're reading this and thinking maybe I'm exaggerating, please believe me. I urge you very strongly to please avoid Flutterwave.I gave them a long bath, I consistently called their customer service lines, no response aggressively followed up with my tickets, but nothing.Please DO NOT use Flutterwave.I am not angry with Flutter or disgruntled, I just don't want anyone to go through what I did -although experiences like this help one build character literally (that's how almost frustrating it was lol)...but from a friend to a friend, please, just avoid them, please.",1,"Oct 27, 2023"

Only wait for 10 days with no one reaching out to me from Flutterwave. I email them to find out there was a problem paying my bank account, they say they are working on it. After days no email back, I email them again they tell me to wait. I wait nothing so I email again and they repeat the same copy and paste email to me.Finally I find out they can't pay to my account currency even though they accepted the account and currency on enrolment.Fine they offer to pay my money into my Flutterwave wallet and I can pay to a different account that is supported. I am now waiting for this to be done, I've sent countless emails and I'm told wait 48 hours then wait 72 hours with my payment never being done.What makes me sad is we need to support our fellow African companies but flutterwave proves again why we will yet again have to use a international payment system because as per the usual an African company cannot conduct the service they promise to you as the customer.Do not use them.",1,"Oct 12, 2023"

We are legitimate business in UK and in Ghana respectively and wanted the ability to accept mobile payment in Ghana and Africa in general but this company is a sham hasn’t allowed us to achieve this. We provided all our legitimate business registration documents in Ghana before we went live and for the past 1 year, our customers have not been able to make any live transactions because flutterwave is now requesting the Same documents from us again. All attempt to get through to them to resolve it has been futile. No dedicated support line and too rigid.

29,Joseph Ononaye,8,"Flutterwave offers me seamless transactions with my international money transfers.With different payment methods to select from, my transfer gets to where I want it in no time.And I'm not worried if anything seems to be wrong, because the customer service is reliable throughout their omnichannels.One time, I mistakenly transferred the wrong amount of money to their account for onward payment to another account; they detected it, halted the transfer, refunded my money, advised me on the proper steps to take next, and my transfer was completed, all within minutes. No needless delays!So even if there's a network problem or something, I can still go to sleep, because I know my money is safe with Flutterwave.I think five things make Flutterwave stand out: Industry foresight, reliable systems, dynamic customer experience, prolific services and innovative thinking.Now, don't think this is a paid review. I simply know how to express myself. And if I had a contrary experience, I won't hesitate to tear the company apart with my review.But I sincerely would say Flutterwave is an amazing organisation that stands shoulder to shoulder with any world-class fintech company in the world.What can they do better? Add some finesse to their User Interface. The Usability is already fantastic!Update on my review:This is exactly 10 months after my initial review. My five-star rating has dropped to four. Here are my thoughts:I believe Flutterwave is a brand that practises social listening. As I had earlier written about the need to improve its app's user interface that was initally just basic and not exciting, and 10 months after, Send by Flutterwave has a simple, easy-to-use and amazing UI (mobile and web). And the AI chatbot is particularly efficient. It saved me once.However, for some reasons, I have experienced countless failed transactions on the app recently, and  I kept getting repitive emails for ID verification. But even after I successfully did my ID verification, these problem persists. Failed Transactions with no explanation many times. Repititive emails to do ID verification after already getting verified succesfully. Seems like there's some bug somewhere.This is why I have reduced my rating for them to 4-stars. The app frustrated me these past few days and no meaningful reason was given.I have had to start exploring Lemfi and TransferGo and they tend to offer better exchange rates.",4,"Updated Dec 24, 2023"
