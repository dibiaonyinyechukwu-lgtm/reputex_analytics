That review was written based on incorrect information that was provided to me at the time, which led to a misunderstanding of the situation.After further clarification, I acknowledge that my initial claims did not fully reflect the facts, and for that, I take responsibility. I regret any inconvenience or misrepresentation this may have caused Jumia or other customers who read my review.I appreciate the clarification received and felt it was important to correct the record. Thank you.",5,3 hours ago,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=1

Fatima Anas,1,"I have been shopping with Jumia for over 5 years now, I never had any issues with my order, the product are high quality and what I ordered but thier staff are very rude and mannerless, the riders are also rude, I ordered for a washing machine and called the pickup station to ask about their pickup opening days and time; this woman insulted the hell out of me and later blocked me, this is very unacceptable of Jumia, I reported to customer care but they don’t seem to be bothered about it",3,"Dec 26, 2025",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=1
Williams,2,I ordered an item a different item entirely was sent to me and an irresistible employee is calling me to tell me rubbish without apologies. And dropping call while we speak where are all this positive reviews coming from? It must be a paid review iOS AppStore should look into this reviews critically they must all be fake reviews because this happened to me 10 years ago and still happened again and inferior products were sent to me in one of my order 1 year ago i threw everything because i dint want any further terrible and terrifying experience again. I forgot my money and avoided them. I thought they would have changed that’s why I came and tried again this time around and i was once more 900% disappointed this is disgraceful and a shame.,1,"Dec 11, 2025",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=1
Victor Iwegbu,1,"I have been using Jumia Nigeria for some time, I have had bitter-sweet experiences. First, I would say they are fast in delivery compared to their counterpart, and they are often reliable with wide range of goods at competitive prices. However, my drawback is the duration it takes to get your money back in a case of charge back or damaged goods, and their customer care takes like forever to respond.Overall it's an average online mall that can do better especially in CRM.",3,"Nov 22, 2025",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=1
LOGICMIND,1,"I honestly don’t understand how a company as big as Jumia can operate with such terrible customer service. I came to pick up my order today and what I met was pure frustration. The crowd was unbelievable — people were everywhere, waiting and standing with no real system in place.What shocked me the most was the complete lack of staff to attend to the growing number of customers. I have been here for over 2 hours, and they haven’t even reached the 35th person on the list. Meanwhile, the number they gave me was 133. At this rate, I probably won’t even be attended to today.To make things worse, my phone is dead, so I can't even show them my tracking ID — and there’s no support or arrangement for situations like this. No charging spot, no backup check system, nothing.This level of disorganization is embarrassing for a company that claims to be one of the biggest e-commerce platforms. Jumia seriously needs to fix their pickup centers, hire more staff, and respect customers’ time. Right now, this experience is nothing but stress, disappointment, and wasted hours.

Bahaa Hamdan,1,"I had high hopes when I first started using Jumia for their online shopping services, but my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. Jumia's service, particularly Jumia Food, has been utterly disappointing and frustrating.Firstly, I made the mistake of paying in advance for an order on Jumia Food, and I deeply regret it. Not only did they deliver the wrong items on numerous occasions, but there were also instances when they failed to deliver anything at all. Despite their blunders, getting a refund from Jumia has become an impossible task. They seem to have no intention of honoring their refund policy, leaving me feeling cheated and taken advantage of.Additionally, I subscribed to Jumia Prime for 12 months, expecting smooth and seamless deliveries without any extra charges. However, to my dismay, they canceled Prime service midway without any valid reason, and to add insult to injury, they didn't even bother to refund the remaining amount. It feels like they simply took my money and left me hanging with unfulfilled promises.The Jumia app itself is a frustrating mess. Their customer service is non-existent, making it nearly impossible to resolve any issues or get the assistance you desperately need. It's disheartening to witness such blatant disregard for their customers' satisfaction and concerns.I strongly advise against dealing with Jumia and their unreliable services. There are far better alternatives out there, like Konga and Jiji, which offer excellent customer service, competitive prices, and reliable deliveries. Don't fall for Jumia's deceptive marketing; they will only disappoint and deceive you. Save yourself the headache and choose another platform for your online shopping needs.In conclusion, my experience with Jumia has been nothing short of a disaster. I regret ever trusting them with my hard-earned money and won't be making that mistake again. Jumia needs a significant overhaul if they ever want to regain the trust of their customers. Until then, I strongly caution everyone to steer clear of Jumia and explore better alternatives for a hassle-free shopping experience.",1,"Aug 4, 2023",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=4
Nukak Asanansi,1,"The worst customer service I have received in my life. I ordered a product and they delivered a broken product. Came back 2 days later to pick up the broken product and I have waited for my refund for over a month with no response. Mind you I have called them 4 different times in this period with my own money and airtime. All 4 times the customer agents told me the same thing even though I had given them all the information needed to chase down my product. Also bear in mind that their policy says refunds are to be done in less than 10 business days. I have been the one chasing down the person that delivered my product, and escalating the issue myself. My order No is 1217927862. It’s a shame that businesses like this allowed to exist where they know nothing about pure decency and respect to customers and have clueless agents that appear to be there just for their paycheck. I resorted to this because I have had it to the top of my cup. I will never ever recommend anyone do business with Jumia. And by the way I am still waiting for my refund.",1,"Jul 18, 2023",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jumia.com.ng?page=4

But bcoz I still had trust in you, I ask for a refund for one and leave the second one to be delivered. Till today neither the refund nor the product has gotten to me. It's really unfair. As a student, 15k is not a small money but you people decides to hold on to my money.

Salvador,3,"Doesn't deserve a single star. Upon placing my order, I then received a phone call to confirm the order at approximately 3:30 pm today. I asked the lady on the phone how long it will take to deliver the food and she responded 40-60 minutes, which is exactly what is stated on Jumia's web/app as well. Sitting here waiting for over an hour I decided to check where my order is to them to my surprise see that it'll take 200 minutes. 200 minutes, this is insane. Immediately I contacted jumia via chat which I started at 4:47 pm today. All I've received in the chat are 3, in 10 seconds written messages, my enquiry is simply ignored. What an outrageous business practice this is. Is this how Jumia as a company wishes to be portrayed?

Alex Ubokwe,1,"Any amount you can't afford to lose, don't shop with it on Jumia. This is because if you have any reason to return the item bought, you won't get a refund. I bought a laptop of 75k, what they brought didn't meet the product description on their website so I returned it. The return was approved over a month ago, till now I'm yet to receive my refund of 75k.I contacted the useless customer service, they first lied to me that the money was paid to my store credit. I checked store credit, there was no money. I checked transaction history to see if there was any transaction, the last transaction was over a year ago.I contacted them again, they asked me to provide a different account number. I gave them a GTBank account number, they promised I was going to receive payment within a week. AS I type this, it's getting to two weeks already, I have not received a dime. I contacted them yet again, they promised they were going to get back to me in 16 hours. As I type this, it's already 48 hours. I didn't get any message from them.Jumia started well but now they have turned to something else. So as it stands now, THE FEAR OF SHOPPING IN JUMIA IS THE BEGINNING OF KEEPING YOUR MONEY SAFE.ANY AMOUNT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE, DON'T SHOP WITH IT ON JUMIA.And to you Jumia (I know one day you will read), come and prove me wrong by giving me evidence that you actually send my refund.

They have withheld my payouts for one Month now, ignored all my follow-up emails, and offered no explanation or timeline for resolution.What’s worse is the complete silence from their so-called Business Review team. No transparency, no accountability, just holding people’s money hostage while pretending to be professional.If this is how they treat their users, then businesses should be very cautious before onboarding with them. A payment platform that can lock your funds without response is not safe to trust.At this point, Paystack feels more like a scam than a legitimate financial service.

Clickfund,1,"As a verified merchant who has used Paystack for a considerable time, I feel deeply disappointed and hurt by how they handle disputes and refunds. I recently experienced a situation where instead of resolving a single customer complaint fairly, Paystack refunded all my earnings—money I legitimately earned and already fulfilled orders for. I lost a significant amount, and I am not alone.Hundreds of other users on Trustpilot and social media are complaining about the same problem—Paystack indiscriminately refunds large sums to customers without consulting the merchant or properly investigating the situation.Let me be clear: being a legitimate financial platform is not about blindly refunding money to avoid disputes. It’s about protecting both buyers and sellers fairly. If a customer wants a refund, reverse only that specific transaction, not all the funds a company has earned. And if you believe a business doesn’t meet your standards, don’t approve them in the first place.What you’re doing right now is reckless and hurts the trust real businesses place in your platform. You’re not just refunding transactions—you’re destroying livelihoods.Please review your policies. Respect merchants. Be transparent.

Martin Keli,1,"I have had an incredibly frustrating experience with Paystack as a payment platform. After using their service for routine test transactions, my business account was flagged for review, which I understood and cooperated with. I provided all the requested information promptly, including detailed business descriptions and platform links. Despite this, Paystack determined my business model to be outside their acceptable use policy and promised to release my funds within 24 hours.That was over a week ago. Since then, I've received vague and repetitive assurances via email and live chat that my payouts were being ""worked on,"" yet no funds have been released. Their handling of my case has been highly unprofessional, with no concrete actions or transparency in resolving this matter.I have attached proof, including screenshots of their emails and live chats, and their poor performance on Trustpilot reviews, which clearly reflect similar patterns of behavior. Paystack’s lack of accountability and repeated delays are unacceptable, and I urge other businesses to proceed with caution when considering their services.If this issue is not resolved immediately, I will escalate it further through consumer protection agencies and legal channels.

Don't make businesses go through a rigorous application process if your intention is to review every transaction anyway. 2. Stop lying to your merchants.

Please find an alternative payment gateway.I am saying this for two reasons; Payout issues and useless customer support.I experienced a payout issue late last month, when I was double paid, an amount was sent to me twice i.e two days in a row, I later received an email that paystack noticed the issue and that they would deduct the amount on the next transaction, I emailed back and said that the action was acknowledged. Now here is the issue. On my next payout, I was offering a service to a client who ordered it online on our website and since the payout takes a few days (which I fail to understand why it does), I had to go back into my pocket and pay for the services using cash I got from somewhere else, long story short, Two weeks, they are sending me my payout after deducting almost 70% of the received amount paid to me .The problem does not end there, their communication is poor, when you send an email to them, they have automated a reply: usually after a minute or so, to guarantee you they are working on you, only for you to find yourself waiting in vain.What am saying is, We trust you with our payments, Why are you taking it for granted?",1,"Sep 17, 2024",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/paystack.com?page=5

As a user of their payment gateway for my VTU website, I recently experienced an unexpected account closure and refund of pending settlements to customers. Despite providing proof of transactions, including the N52,000 payment from my Customer for Airtime and Data Bundles, Paystack has failed to pay out these funds to me.This failure to honor the payout has resulted in a significant financial loss for my business. It's disheartening to note that I am not the only one facing such issues. Other business owners, like Joseph, who lost over 1 million Naira in pending settlements, have also been affected by Paystack's lack of accountability and failure to fulfill their obligations.The lack of transparency and communication from Paystack is alarming. Their actions have not only caused financial harm to my business but have also shattered my trust in their service. I strongly caution against using Paystack for your payment processing needs, as they cannot be trusted to follow through on their commitments.In conclusion, my experience with Paystack highlights their failure to honor payouts and their overall lack of accountability. I hope that by sharing my story, others can avoid the financial losses and frustrations I have endured due to Paystack's negligence.",1,"Apr 13, 2024",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/paystack.com?page=5

I was informed I would receive my parcel on the 9th January 2026.  I waited until 1126 hrs for a time slot.  It was given at 1642-1842 hours. I tracked the van and I have now learnt that my parcel is stuck on the van and is now due to be delivered on the next working day.  As it was a Friday delivery and the next working day is a Monday I will now have to wait another 2 days for my shipment.  To add insult DHL have chosen the same delivery times as before.  So am I to expect if the driver has too many deliveries once again my parcel will be left on the van for another day?  I am not sure who is at fault is it the driver or is it DHL for putting pressure on the driver to deliver too many parcels.   Either way it is I that have suffered because I waited in all day on Friday tracking the van only to find at 1700 hours at delivery number 38 (I was 40) there were no movements in fact there were no updates for over an hour.  Did DHL email in that time to advise what was happening no DHL did not! I received no communication in any form it was because I was constantly checking that I found out my parcel was left on the van. I am very angry about the appalling treatment from DHL.

David Gutierrez,3,"DHL lies about the delivery dates and times after messaging you, the driver doesnt try to ring the building buzzer and simply left, after calling the phone services they promise to redeliver the next day but then never try to do it for days and ignore any previous agreements. This is even worse with the prices they're charging for such poor services and lack of professionalism.",1,"Jan 2, 2026",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/dhl.com?page=5
Jake Evers,1,"I am unsure why US-based companies engage DHL for deliveries to US addresses in that DHL often partners and punts the package to the inept business practices of our United States Postal Service (USPS) for last-mile delivery to residences. After that, DHL takes no responsibility for the package and instructs the package recipient to contact the USPS. In turn, the USPS that leaves no posted notice at residence recommends contacting DHL as the DHL tracking number has no reference for USPS. As a result of the above, this most recent instance,  purchased product is being returned to seller as undeliverable after 3 attempts at a residential address with 24-hour package acceptance via its own mailroom and security detail. Merchants must stop engaging DHL for US (domestic) deliveries.",1,"Jan 2, 2026",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/dhl.com?page=5
